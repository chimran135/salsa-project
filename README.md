# Project: Fast, accurate and explainable sentiment analysis with SALSA

## Overview:
The SALSA project, funded by the European Research Council under a Proof-of-Concept Grant, aims to leverage recently-developed fast syntactic parsing techniques to build sentiment analysis systems that are lightweight and efficient, while still providing accuracy and explainability through the explicit use of syntax. We intend our approaches to be the backbone of a working product of interest for SMEs to use in production.

## Fine-tuned Sequence Labeling Parsing Models
To download fine-tuned Sequence Labeling Parsing Models please click on <a href="https://www.grupolys.org/~imran/models.zip" target="_blank">Download Models</a>. Upon extracting "models.zip" file you will find "rel-distilbert-en" and "rel-distilbert-es" find fine-tunned models for both English and Spanish respectively.
