# Project: Fast, accurate and explainable sentiment analysis with SALSA

## Overview:
The SALSA project, funded by the European Research Council under a Proof-of-Concept Grant, aims to leverage recently-developed fast syntactic parsing techniques to build sentiment analysis systems that are lightweight and efficient, while still providing accuracy and explainability through the explicit use of syntax. We intend our approaches to be the backbone of a working product of interest for SMEs to use in production.

## Acknowledgments
This project has received funding by the European Research Council (ERC), under the Horizon Europe research
and innovation programme (SALSA, grant agreement No 101100615).
